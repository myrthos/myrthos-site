The `mstyle` shortcode was created to style certain parts of a markdown file using predefined classes. This could then be used for underline, subscript, superscript, etc.  
This is especially useful given that for this site HTML is disabled in markdown files.

Check the {{< link "usage" >}}usage{{< /link >}} page for the details on how to use this functionality, and the {{< link "installation" >}}installation{{< /link >}} page on how to install the `mstyle` functionality.
