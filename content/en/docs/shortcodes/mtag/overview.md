The `mtag` shortcode was created to allow a limited set of HTML tags in markdown. By default the usage of HTML in markdown is disabled for this site, but there are some tags that are still needed.

Currently the following HTML tags are supported:

- `br`: Creates a break resulting a in new line.
- `nobr`: Results in text embedded by this tag to not break when the browser wants to wrap text to the next line.

Check the {{< link "usage" >}}usage{{< /link >}} page for the details on how to use this functionality, and the {{< link "installation" >}}installation{{< /link >}} page on how to install the `mtag` functionality.
